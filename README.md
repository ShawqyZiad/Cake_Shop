# Cake_Shop
Every business is going online nowadays for better growth and productivity. We are going to build an online cake shop website that will represent the shop in a good manner having features of online ordering and views and many more.

Prerequisites:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


Approach:
- We first create an HTML file where we have declared the basic structure of a website.
- We have created a Header, main, products, about, and contact-us section on the web page.
- We have added images in the background with the help of CSS.
- We have aligned the products with the help of Flexbox in CSS.
For responsiveness, we have added a media query and for the header, we have added a hamburger menu button that will work with the help of JavaScript.
